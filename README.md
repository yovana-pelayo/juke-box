## Project

Take a look at the demo pages for how-to's, ideas, inspiration. Feel free to copy,
but use _as you build_. Do not copy and change values!

Build your page in the following files:

File | Purpose
---|---
`index.html` | Main page with html and semantic elements
`global.css` | css for your page
`app.js`     | JavaScript to dynamically change presentation

## Commit

As you are working and complete small steps, stop and make a commit using the 
build-in VSCode sidebar tool:

- "Stage" the files you want to commit
- Enter a commit message and hit `CMD + ENTER` or `CTRL + ENTER` (mac or windows)

To "push" to GitHub, either hit "Sync" after committing, or hit the recycle wheel button in the lower left corner.

## Assignment

Create a list of cards that have a button for playing an associated sound. The project will move these phases:

1. Static (hard-coded) ~3 cards with event listeners that play a unique sound.
1. Create "data" of an array and an object for each card. Add at least 10 items.
1. Make a template for a card, and use JavaScript to:
    1. Copy the template
    1. Insert the data values
    1. Attach the event listener for playing the sound
